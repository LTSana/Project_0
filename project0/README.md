# Project 0

My Project 0 is a little puzzel game. 

* It contains 7 HTML5 pages.
1. index.html
2. layout.html
3. page_1.html
4. page_2.html
5. page_3.html
6. page_4.html
7. secret.html

## Index Page
This is the home page for all visitors.
Here we give the users a little detail on what they need to do and we give them the links to the other pages to explore and find the numbers needed to find the secret page.

## HOLE page_1.html
This page is easy and contains a hint for the user in color Aqua. The code in this page is '26'

## CAVE page_2.html
This page is a little harder. The numbers are in the description of whats on the doors.
Door #@&$* is 2.
Door #%*(% is 57.
Door $X_X$ is 1219, but in order to see it you need to click on the red font were a Javascript will fetch the image and display it on the page.

## VOID page_3.html
This page is easy again, the code is the values of VOID in decimal: V=86 O=79 I=73 D=68.

## ... page_4.html
This page is to waste users time, there is nothing to find thats way its a black hole.

The code now has been found
* 26257121986797368

The code can be used in the input box(it only accpets numbers).
If the code the user places in the box is correct a now link will show up in the middle of the page.
The link will send the user to a secret page were there'll be a image.
